**The Grand Line Archives** is a community-driven, open-source platform designed to document the vast world of *One Piece*. Unlike a standard wiki, this platform focuses on **interconnected evidence chains**, allowing fans to bridge the gap between confirmed facts and deep-sea theories.

## 🗺️ Project Vision
Our goal is to create a "Digital Poneglyph"—a permanent, searchable, and highly interactive record of Oda's world-building.
- **Evidence-First:** Every theory must be backed by "Evidence Tags" (Chapters, SBS, Cover Stories).
- **Anti-Spoiler:** A robust "Knowledge Level" system that hides content based on where you are in the story.
- **Collaborative:** Anyone can submit a theory via a Pull Request or our integrated CMS.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
Built with the modern "Grand Line" stack for speed, SEO, and scalability:
* **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* **Database & Auth:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL)
* **Content:** [Velite](https://velite.js.org/) (Turning MDX files into type-safe data)
* **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
